val_test01.cpp

error 1: since n = 10, so only allocate 10 ints size to x, but in line 82, when i = 10, it will access to x[10], which is illgal.
error 2: delete [] x cannot successfully free x;

val_test02.cpp

error 1: Conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised value(s)

line 89 and line 90, since x[6] and x[7] are uninitialised.

solution: initialize x[6] and x[7] before accessing.
